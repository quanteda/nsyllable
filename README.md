## About

Counts syllables in character vectors. For English, this looks up
syllables from the [Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing
Dictionary](https://github.com/cmusphinx/cmudict), or guesses the
syllables as the number of vowel sequences for words not found.
User-supplied syllable word lists are also supported.

We hope to add lookup tables for additional languages in the future.

## How to Install

From CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("nsyllable")
```

From GitHub:

``` r
# remotes package required to install nsyllable from Github 
remotes::install_github("quanteda/nsyllable") 
```

## Usage

`nsyllable()` counts the syllables in each element of a character
vector, and returns the integer vector of the syllable counts. If
`use.names = TRUE`, then the output vector is named. The default
language implemented is English.

``` r
library("nsyllable")

charvec <- c("testing", "Aachen", "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious")
nsyllable(charvec)
## [1]  2  2 14
nsyllable(charvec, use.names = TRUE)
##                            testing                             Aachen 
##                                  2                                  2 
## supercalifragilisticexpialidocious 
##                                 14
```

User-supplied dictionaries can also be used, and these will override the
`language` argument. Below, “excellent” is still (correctly) counted,
but not because it looked up the results in the English dictionary, but
because it counted the vowel sequences. This gets “noel” wrong, however.

``` r
nsyllable(c("excellent", "noel", "film"), use.names = TRUE)
## excellent      noel      film 
##         3         2         1

# redefine the syllables as it's pronounced in parts of Ireland
mydict <- c("film" = 2L)
# looks up "excellent" and does the vowel count
nsyllable(c("excellent", "noel", "film"), syllable_dictionary = mydict, use.names = TRUE)
## excellent      noel      film 
##         3         1         2
```

### With other languages

To not use the English dictionary and count only vowel sequences, set
`syllable_dictionary` to `NULL`. This will likely to be a good
approximation for many Western languages.

``` r
nsyllable(c("Dies", "ist", "eine", "Demonstration"), syllable_dictionary = NULL,
          use.names = TRUE)
##          Dies           ist          eine Demonstration 
##             1             1             2             4
```

A separate algorithm for counting syllables is implemented for Polish,
giving more accuracy than basic vowel sequence counting. The user might
expect incorrect results for words with “au” and “eu” sequences, as
their pronunciation is not consistent.

``` r
nsyllable(c("Ziemia", "wyszczekany", "miauczenie", "autobus", "kakao"),
          language = "pl", use.names = TRUE)
##      Ziemia wyszczekany  miauczenie     autobus       kakao 
##           2           4           3           3           3
```
